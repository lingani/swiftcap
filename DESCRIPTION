Description: A typeahead prediction model suggests words as a user types to
    improve typing efficiency on constrained mobile devices. This is akin to
    products such as Swiftkey which is available for Android and iOS mobile
    devices. This was completed as the Project Capstone for the Data Science
    Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.
